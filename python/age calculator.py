# here we can calculate our age. we will take constant number of 100 years you will be able to alive. we only assume your average age is 100 years
age = input("what is your current age")
year  = 100 - int(age)
weeks = 52 * year
month = 12 * year
y_year = 1 * year
print(f"your current age ige {y_year} years old  your weeks left {weeks} and your month left {month} ")


# now, we successfully finished this project
